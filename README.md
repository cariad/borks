## Images

To embed images, they must be stored in a [page bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).

Your bundle's `index.md` should contain data like this:

```yaml
---
headless: true
resources:
  # "name" is the reference to this image from shortcodes and the "image" front
  # matter property.
  - name: parade
    params:
      # Accessible text.
      alt: An ice cream parade on Pluto.

      # Anchor point when the image is resized. Choose from "TopLeft", "Top",
      # "TopRight", "Left", "Center", "Right", "BottomLeft", "Bottom",
      # "BottomRight" or "Smart".
      # Optional and defaults to "Smart".
      anchor: Top

    src:  spine.jpg
    title: Ice Cream Parade
---
```

To embed this image in a page, use the `image` shortcode:

```markdown
Do you remember last year's ice cream parade?

{{< image parade >}}

It was so good!
```
